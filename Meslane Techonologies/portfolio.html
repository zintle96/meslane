            <h2>Biography:</h2>
        <p>My name is <strong>Zintle Meslane</strong>. I am a very passionate person,<br> observant and I am always keen to
            learn something new which is<br> one of the reasons why I love challenges. Being a
            student at UWC for a few <br>years has provided me with many experiences, few of which are being a very<br>
            resourceful individual, I can figure things out on my own, and
            I am a <br>fast learner and can use certain tools to the benefit of the client.<br> Apart from my
            eagerness to learn I have very good communication skills,<br> I listen very carefully with detail and
            have the ability to speak clearly so as to<br> get along well with my co-workers and clients.
            I work well under pressure.<br> I consider respecting my time as well as the time of others very
            important<br>, which makes punctuality as one of my special qualities.<br> Being exposed to coding has allowed
            me to<br> acquire different qualities as an individual, as well as in my profession.</p>
